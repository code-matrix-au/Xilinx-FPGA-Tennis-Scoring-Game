2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net nolabel_line46/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin nolabel_line46/l_score_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell nolabel_line46/l_score_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net nolabel_line46/out_reg[1]_0[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin nolabel_line46/r_score_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell nolabel_line46/r_score_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net nolabel_line46/out_reg[1]_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin nolabel_line46/next_state_reg[0]_i_2/O, cell nolabel_line46/next_state_reg[0]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net nolabel_line46/out_reg[3]_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin nolabel_line46/serving_reg_i_2/O, cell nolabel_line46/serving_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>
